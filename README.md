# Variational Autoencoders for Financial Distribution Modeling: A Comprehensive Study

## Abstract

This repository presents a comprehensive study on using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their variants to model complex financial return distributions, comparing them to classical statistical methods. We explore optimized, enhanced, hybrid, and quantum-inspired VAEs, evaluating their performance in capturing tail risks using metrics like KS test, KL divergence, JSD, and VaR. Results show classical distributions (e.g., Student-t) outperform VAEs in tail modeling, but hybrid approaches show promise. The code is designed for reproducibility, with testing for robustness across market regimes and anomalies. This work contributes to generative AI in finance, with extensions to healthcare and cybersecurity.

## Introduction

Financial data, such as stock returns, often exhibit heavy tails and non-Gaussian characteristics that classical distributions struggle to model accurately. Generative models like VAEs offer a promising alternative by learning latent representations. This project implements and evaluates several VAE variants, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and potential applications. The repository is structured for both practical use (GitHub) and academic publication (IEEE-style), with standalone scripts, documentation, and outputs for easy reproduction.

#### Statistical Distribution Fitting and Comparison
- **Classical Distributions**: Fitting of normal, Student's t, Laplace, Cauchy, gamma, lognormal using SciPy.stats (e.g., `stats.norm.fit()`, `stats.t.fit()`) and Fitter library for automatic selection based on AIC/BIC criteria. For example, the Student's t-distribution probability density function (PDF) is:

  $$
  f(x \mid \nu, \mu, \sigma) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu+1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\nu \pi} \, \sigma \, \Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{\nu \sigma^2}\right)^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}
  $$

  where \(\nu\) is the degrees of freedom, \(\mu\) is the location parameter, and \(\sigma\) is the scale parameter.

- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test**: `scipy.stats.kstest()` to compare empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of real vs. synthetic data for goodness-of-fit. The test statistic is the maximum deviation:

  $$
  D = \sup_x |F_n(x) - F(x)|
  $$

  where \(F_n(x)\) is the empirical CDF from the sample, and \(F(x)\) is the theoretical CDF.

- **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence**: Histogram-based estimation (`np.sum(hist_real * np.log(hist_real / hist_vae))`) to measure how much one probability distribution differs from another:

  $$
  D_{\text{KL}}(P \parallel Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}
  $$

  (for discrete distributions; integrated for continuous).

- **Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)**: `scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon()` for a symmetric, bounded measure of divergence [0,1]:

  $$
  \text{JSD}(P \parallel Q) = \frac{1}{2} D_{\text{KL}}(P \parallel M) + \frac{1}{2} D_{\text{KL}}(Q \parallel M), \quad M = \frac{P + Q}{2}
  $$

- **Empirical CDF**: Interpolated using `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` for non-parametric comparisons of distributions without assuming a form.

#### Generative Modeling (VAE)
- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Loss**: The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective, which lower-bounds the log-likelihood. It consists of reconstruction loss + KL divergence. Reconstruction uses Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood (simplified to mean squared error (MSE) in code assuming unit variance):

  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2
  $$

  The KL divergence term (for standard Gaussian prior \(p(z) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)\)):

  $$
  D_{\text{KL}}(q(z|x) \parallel p(z)) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^J \left(1 + \log \sigma_j^2 - \mu_j^2 - \sigma_j^2 \right)
  $$

  Total ELBO loss: 

  $$
  \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} - \beta \, D_{\text{KL}}
  $$

  where \(\beta\) controls the trade-off in Beta-VAE.

- **Reparameterization Trick**: Enables backpropagation through stochastic sampling by reparameterizing the latent variable:

  $$
  z = \mu + \sigma \odot \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
  $$

  where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication.

- **Beta-VAE and KL Annealing**: The KL term is weighted by \(\beta\) and annealed linearly over epochs: \(w_t = \min(1, t / T)\) for epoch \(t\) out of total epochs \(T\), to stabilize training and encourage disentanglement.

- **Heavy-Tailed Priors**: In `enhanced_vae.py`, the prior \(p(z)\) is replaced with Student-t or Lévy-stable distributions to better model fat tails, modifying the KL term to:

  $$
  D_{\text{KL}}(q(z|x) \parallel p(z))
  $$

  with non-Gaussian \(p(z)\) (e.g., Student-t PDF as above).

#### Risk and Financial Metrics
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Empirical percentile calculation (`np.percentile(returns, 5)`) at confidence levels \(\alpha = 0.05\) (95%) or 0.01 (99%):

  $$
  \text{VaR}_\alpha = \inf \left\{ x \mid P(X \leq x) \geq \alpha \right\}
  $$

  representing the loss threshold exceeded with probability \(\alpha\).

- **Expected Shortfall (ES)**: The conditional expected loss beyond VaR:

  $$
  \text{ES}_\alpha = \mathbb{E}[X \mid X \leq \text{VaR}_\alpha]
  $$

- **Historical Simulation**: Non-parametric method in `hybrid_model.py` for extreme tails, involving bootstrap resampling from the empirical distribution of historical returns.

#### Testing and Robustness
- **Anomaly Injection**: Synthetic outliers are added via mixture models, e.g., 5-20% contamination with values from the Cauchy distribution (PDF):

  $$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi (1 + x^2)}
  $$

  to simulate heavy-tailed anomalies.

- **Temporal Analysis**: Uses rolling windows for fitting and testing across market regimes, classifying volatility with thresholds like \(\sigma > 2 \times \text{median}(\sigma)\), where \(\sigma\) is the rolling standard deviation.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Generates \(N = 10,000\) synthetic samples from the VAE latent space for scenario analysis and stress testing, approximating integrals via sampling.

These algorithms are standard in statistics (e.g., from "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie et al.) and finance (e.g., VaR from Basel accords), implemented with NumPy, SciPy, and PyTorch for accuracy and efficiency. Equations are derived from core theory, with code approximations for practicality (e.g., MSE proxy for NLL assuming unit variance). For full derivations, refer to the cited literature.

### VAE Architecture
Standard VAE: Encoder (Linear-ReLU layers to mu/logvar), reparameterization, decoder. Variants:
- Optimized: Deeper nets (128-64-32), Adam lr=1e-3, 200 epochs.
- Enhanced: Student-t prior in KL term, asymmetric loss for tails.
- Hybrid: VAE for 95% bulk, historical extremes for 5% tails.
- Quantum: Qiskit for Hadamard superposition sampling in latent space.

Loss: Reconstruction (Gaussian NLL) + β-KL divergence, with annealing.

### Evaluation
- Classical fitting: SciPy/fitter for norm, t, Laplace, gamma, etc.
- Metrics: KS test, KL/JSD divergence, VaR (95%/99%), ES.
- Testing: Temporal (2017 calm, 2020 volatile), anomaly injection (5-20% outliers).

## Results

- Classical Student-t best fits tails (KS p>0.05 in 70% cases).
- VAEs underestimate VaR by 87-103% in volatile periods.
- Hybrid reduces underestimation to 45%, JSD <0.1.
- Quantum VAE improves sample diversity (entropy +15%).
- Outputs in `outputs/`: Plots (e.g., final_model_comparison.png), samples (.npy), results (.csv).

## Discussion

VAEs excel in bulk distribution but fail tails due to Gaussian priors. Hybrids bridge this gap, but quantum enhancements need hardware scaling. Limitations: Computational cost, data scarcity for extremes.
